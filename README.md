# Side-Projects-C-

Some side projects I did in C and Python.

Tried to see if I could create a left aligned pyramid with recursion in mario.c

With qr.py, it just generates a QR code for you. I included an example image
which can be scanned. To create your own QR code, the file should be edited
and the link changed.

With mario.py, I created a better pyramid than the one in mario.c as my first
python code.

Lyrics generator allows you to choose from a list of songs the lyrics for a
particular song.

Is palindrome just checks if a given word is a palindrome or not.
